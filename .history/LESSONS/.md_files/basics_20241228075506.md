----> you need to use **relative paths** not **absolute path** 

## **Absolute path** 

- is the full address or location of a file folder in your system. It specifies the complete path starting from the root of the filesystem, meaning it gives the entire "adress" to locate a file

e.g.: [C:\Users\Username\Documents\Project\images\image.png]

- C:\ is root directory
- location is **fixed** and **specific** to
  your computer/environment
- not portable - if you move project to different computer
  the path will not work

## **Relative Path**

- describes the location of a file or folder in **in relation**
  to another file or folder. Doesnt include the full system path; instead it starts from the current location

  e.g: [images/image.png]

- **flexible** and **portable** - can be used across different
  systems and locations as long as the folder structure is the same
