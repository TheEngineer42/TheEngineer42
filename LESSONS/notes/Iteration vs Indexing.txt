ITERATION VS INDEXING

Iteration:
- process of going through each element in a sequence(one at a time) 

for char in "hello":
    ...


means that we are accessing each character separtely: h, e, l, l, o 



Indexing:
- how we refer to the position of each character (counting starts at 0)
0 - h
1 - e
2 - l
3 - l
4 - o
