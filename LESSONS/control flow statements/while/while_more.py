Why use while True?
Using while True is often a convenient way to write a loop 
when you want the program to keep running continuously 
until some specific condition or event happens. 
You don't know exactly how many iterations you want a
head of time (as opposed to a for loop), 
so you keep looping until a certain condition tells the program to exit.

How do you stop the loop?
To stop the while True loop, you use the break statement. 
The break keyword immediately exits the loop, no matter where
it is in the loop.

Example with while True and break
Hereâ€™s how you can use while True with 
break to repeatedly ask for user input, 
process that input, and stop the loop when 
the user decides to stop.
